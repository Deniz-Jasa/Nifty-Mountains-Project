# Nifty Mountains Assignement - Deniz Jasarbasic

**Description**: This program reads in a set of topographic mountain elevation data into a 2D array and writes methods to compute and visualize various paths through the mountains. 

The program also draws the actual mountain given the data into a 2D map using monochrome or interpolated colors. This program will also return various total elevation changes given different "best" paths across the mountain and provide path results, a meaningful analysis, and insighful statistics, such as efficiency metrics.

This program finds the paths in an iterative method using 3 different algorithms, a greddy algorithm, an improved greddy alogirthm, and the floyd-marshall algorithm.

This project is based on and solves the Standford Mountain Climb Project http://nifty.stanford.edu/2016/franke-mountain-paths/
