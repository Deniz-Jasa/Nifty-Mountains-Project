# Nifty Mountains Assignement - Deniz Jasarbasic

Description: This program reads in a set of topographic elevation data into a 2D array and write methods to compute various paths through the mountains as well as visualize them using the Allegro graphics library. This program will also return various total elevation changes given different "best" paths across the mountain. Additionally, the program will provide path results, a meaningful analysis, and insighful statistics, such as efficiency metrics.
