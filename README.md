# Nifty Mountains Assignement - Deniz Jasarbasic

Description: This program reads in a set of topographic elevation data into a 2D array and writes methods to compute various paths through the mountains as well as visualizes them. This program will also return various total elevation changes given different "best" paths across the mountain and provide path results, a meaningful analysis, and insighful statistics, such as efficiency metrics.

This program finds the paths in an iterative method using 3 different algorithms, a greddy algorithm, an improved greddy alogirthm, and the floyd-marshall algorithm.

This project is based on and solves the Standford Mountain Climb Project http://nifty.stanford.edu/2016/franke-mountain-paths/
